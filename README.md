Description
===========

This folder contains all sniffs which we (re)implemented to match the TYPO3 Coding Guidelines. We call it the SniffPool.

How to install
==============

Since this standard is a dependency of `TYPO3CMS <https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3CMS>`_ and `TYPO3Flow <https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3Flow>`_ standard, you don't need to install this standard directly. It will automatically installed when you install one of the mentioned standards. 


How to use
==========

Since it is an own standard it is possible to call it. **This is not recommended! It will raise weird errors.**

We provide separate standards who match the coding guidelines of TYPO3CMS and TYPO3Flow.
