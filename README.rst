====================================
The TYPO3 PHP_CodeSniffer Sniff Pool
====================================

Description
===========
This folder we call "the sniff pool" which is the home of all sniffs which we (re)implemented for our Coding Guidelines.

How to use
==========
Technically its possible to use this as standard by PHPCS (phpcs --standard=TYPO3 /path/to/file), because its a own standard.
But this is not recommended because this folder contains ALL sniffs for TYPO3v4, FLOW3, so the result of the codesniffer will be wrong.
